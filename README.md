 # React Name Picker application

  This application randomly picks two names for our daily Scrum Refinement meeting. It's linked to a FireBase database where it stores the outcomes everytime you use the app. It therefore also takes into consideration who is present today, and how many times people have been picked in the past.

## Background

I'm a beginning front-end developer. Everyday I make sure two of my colleagues (also developers) refine a couple of Scrum user stories. Because I was picking names by hand, creating an app to do it for me seemed like a much better idea. Because I just started to learn React, this was my first project.
